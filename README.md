# Password-Manager
Hello everyone, This is my fisrt node js application.
check it out here : https://my-password-manager-test.herokuapp.com/login

This is a very basic password manager app that can generate long random passwords including characters,symbols and numbers, and saves them so you could look them up any time. 

this project was made with node js, express js and mongoDB, and I used passport js to store all your passwords securly hashed in the database.
